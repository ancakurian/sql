# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model
## Question 1
## Question 2
## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?
```
Your answer...
``` Yes, generally speaking there are privacy concerns when gathering customers' personal information. The business entity bears responsibility for legally and ethically collecting and storing data of their customers. Whithing the business, there has to be restricte access policies in place to protect customers' privacy. Apart of that there have to be contractual stipulations prohibiting data use by a thirs party without consent and for the benefit of other parties involved other than the customers.
However, keeping records of previous personal information falls under the same legal and ethical provisions as keeping records of current personal information.'''

## Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LMu4W.gif)
Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?
```
Your answer...
```AdventureWorks is a complex schema that contains much more information in comparison with the Bookstore model design. The number of tables and the intrecated relationships between them justify color-coding the schema, for easier reading and understanding of its content.

The length of the tables contained in the AdventureWorks database differs significantly. Some tables contain no more than two columns, while others containg more than 20. The tables in the Bookstore database are more homogenous as structure, containing between 4 and 7 columns.

In a project with a high degree of complexity, I would like to use color-codes to make the chart easier to read.
